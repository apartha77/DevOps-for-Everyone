## An Introduction to Python

We will learn Python from scratch. To learn any language we need to learn its elements, similar to what how we learn English. So let us see the elements of Python comparing it to English learning:
1. Vocalubary/words - variables and **Reserver words** - use this words the way Python expects us to use, we cannot use it as a **variable**.

2. Sentence structure - validate syntax patterns (set of instructions)

3. Story structure - constructing a program for a purpose. Write 2-3 lines of script on command prompt >>>, interactive mode but not more, reason bigger set of scripts or instructions should be written in a file and save it with extension **.py** .py is python file. Thus choose ***Interactive*** vs ***Script*** as per your purpose.
